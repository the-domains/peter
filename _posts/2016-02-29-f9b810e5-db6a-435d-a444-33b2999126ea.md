"No one is coming."

That is the defining quote of self-responsibility. Being aware of our aloneness. That we are the causes of change and not victims suffering as effects.

It means to hold ourselves accountable for our lives. For our financial, emotional, spiritual, physical, mental health.

It means to not blame external circumstances for what happens in our lives. It means to not attribute power to those that do not have power at all. It means to not give up our power to avoid the weight of responsibility.

Doesn't that sound nice?

To be in control of your own life, to be in control of your own circumstances, to be in control of your own destiny. 

It sounds amazing, until we have to lift that weight. The mental weight of knowing you are responsible for your life. Knowing that you are now vulnerable to being criticized, to being blamed, to being wrong - to being not enough.

That's when you want to just throw it all up in the air, leave it up to chance, and hope to rid yourself of the responsibility. Without responsibility, there can be no blame. And with no blame, you won't ever have to face the fear that you might not be loved.

See, we don't fear responsibility. We fear the criticism that we'll eventually have to face.

We fear the judgment that will result. Not from others, but more likely the made-up representation of others we have in our heads.

It's funny how we have the highest expectations of ourselves.
